A quick daily tracker for the currently ending Mayple Event specifically tracking maple leaves for mule gearing.
- This program will be used for a 2 day recording stint (the last 2 days of the event)

Brainstorming:

1. Having a dedicated tab to enter character details -> Calling it the Character Details Tab (CDT for short)
2. Having a dedicated tab to receive all the different characters that get submitted from the character details tab -> Calling it the Character List Tab (CLT for short)
3. Having a dedicated tab to statistics for analytical reasons -> Calling it the Statistical Analysis Tab (SAT for short)
    3.1 How many characters have been completed? (Gotten the required maple leaves for the day)
    3.2 A saved state of character progress that spans more than a da
        3.2.1 text file storage utilised?
4. Compartmentalising for a design layout for better visualisation and user readability
